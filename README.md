# module-1-challenge
This is a repository for the module 1 challenge.

## Description
This is a repository for a module in which we had to refactor a starter code. In this module I worked on skills such as making sure proper HTML semantics were used, working with the git flow and adjusting links for CSS and HTML pages.

## User Story
AS A marketing agency<br>
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards<br>
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines<br>

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards<br>
WHEN I view the source code<br>
THEN I find semantic HTML elements<br>
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements<br>
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning<br>
WHEN I view the image elements<br>
THEN I find accessible alt attributes<br>
WHEN I view the heading attributes<br>
THEN they fall in sequential order<br>
WHEN I view the title element<br>
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title<br>
