# webpage-refactor
This is a repository for the module 1 challenge.

## Description
This is a repository for a module in which we had to refactor a starter code. In this module I worked on skills such as making sure proper HTML semantics were used, working with the git flow and adjusting links for CSS and HTML pages.

## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
